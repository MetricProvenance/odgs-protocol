# ODGS Maturity: The Business Value Guide

## Introduction

In the modern enterprise, data governance is no longer a back-office administrative task — it is a critical driver of compliance, security, and institutional value. The Open Data Governance Standard (ODGS) Maturity Model is designed to bridge the gap between technical reality and executive visibility.

This guide explains **why** measuring your data governance maturity is essential, **how** the ODGS assessment works, and **how to** use the results to drive automated, measurable improvements.

## 1. Why Measure Maturity? (The Business Case)

Many organisations struggle to quantify their data governance posture. When Chief Data Officers (CDOs) ask, *"Are we compliant with DORA or the EU AI Act?"* or *"Can we trust the provenance of our data?"*, the answers are often anecdotal or buried in disconnected spreadsheets.

The ODGS Maturity Model solves this by providing:

1. **Objective Quantification:** It translates abstract governance concepts into a hard, reproducible score (0–100%).
2. **Risk Surfacing:** It highlights exactly where your organisation is exposed, breaking down compliance risks into actionable technical gaps.
3. **The ROI Baseline:** By establishing a baseline (e.g., 32% maturity), you can justify investments in automation and track the ROI as the score improves (e.g., to 75%).
4. **Engineering-to-Executive Alignment:** It gives engineering teams a mathematical, evidence-based language to communicate infrastructure needs to CDOs and executive boards.

## 2. How the Model Works

The ODGS Maturity Assessment evaluates your organisation across **8 Core Pillars**:

1. **Governance Foundations (GOV):** Are rules bound to business processes? Do context bindings map governance to reality?
2. **Quality Enforcement (QE):** Are rules enforced with executable logic? Are there owners — real people accountable?
3. **Operational Readiness (OPS):** Is the interceptor installed? Is enforcement set to `strict` (blocking) or `permissive` (logging only)?
4. **Metadata Integrity (META):** Is the ontology populated with real terms? Do metrics have calculation logic?
5. **Usage & Analytics (USE):** Are rules linked to measurable DQ dimensions? Can improvement be tracked?
6. **Organisational Adoption (ORG):** Have rules been customised for your industry? Are contexts bound to enforcement?
7. **Certification & Trust (CERT):** Are regulation packs installed and cryptographically signed? Is the sovereign audit trail configured?
8. **Bridge Connectivity (BRIDGE):** Are source systems connected? Is there diversity in connection types?

Based on the configuration in your `odgs-workspace.yaml`, the assessment assigns a score and categorises your maturity into a tier (e.g., *Developing*, *Measured*, *Optimised*).

## 3. How-To: Executing the Assessment

### Step 1: Run the Diagnostic
Your engineering team installs the diagnostic tool via the command line:
```bash
pip install odgs-maturity
odgs-maturity assess --workspace ./odgs-workspace.yaml
```

### Step 2: Generate the Charter
The tool evaluates your workspace and generates a **Governance Charter**. This document is not just a score — it is a detailed breakdown of your gaps, prioritised by business impact.
- **Example Gap:** "Missing sovereign audit trail (CERT-03: 0%)"
- **Business Impact:** "High risk of failure in compliance audits."

### Step 3: Present to Leadership
Engineers use the generated Charter to present the findings to the CDO. The Charter will typically indicate that manually closing these gaps requires **6–12 weeks of consultant time**.

### Step 4: Close the Gaps
Organisations can engage a **Metric Provenance certified implementation partner** to deploy pre-configured certified packs that close the identified gaps far faster than manual remediation. Partners handle the full delivery — Metric Provenance issues the certified IP layer.

> The [European Data Governance Maturity Benchmark 2026](https://benchmark.metricprovenance.com) assessed 99 enterprises across the EU. Average governance maturity: **37.6%** — a 62.4% enforcement gap against regulatory requirements. For executive context, see [metricprovenance.com/pricing](https://metricprovenance.com/pricing).

### Step 5: Verify and Certify
Re-run the maturity assessment after deploying the certified packs. The score will reflect the improvements (e.g., jumping from 32% to 65%+). You can then generate **S-Cert Certificates** to cryptographically prove your compliance to auditors and partners.

## Conclusion

The ODGS Maturity Model is not just a test; it is the starting point of your automated governance journey. By diagnosing the exact gaps in your architecture, it enables you to deploy targeted, certified solutions that turn compliance from a manual burden into an automated, verifiable asset.
