# Open Data Governance Schema (ODGS) Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the Open Data Governance Schema (ODGS) project. The project is maintained by Authentic Intelligence Labs with the goal of establishing a universal standard for algorithmic accountability.

## Project Leadership

The project is led by **Authentic Intelligence Labs** (Founded by Kartik Iyer), who serve as the core maintainers and steer the strategic direction of the protocol.

### Responsibilities
*   Setting the technical direction and roadmap (e.g., v2.0 improvements).
*   Reviewing and merging Pull Requests.
*   Managing releases and package distribution (PyPI, npm).
*   Upholding the Code of Conduct.

## Decision Making

Major architectural decisions and schema changes are proposed via **Enhancement Proposals** (or GitHub Issues labeled `proposal`) and discussed openly. While community feedback is vital, final decision-making authority rests with the Project Leadership to ensure alignment with the core mission of AI Safety and Compliance.
